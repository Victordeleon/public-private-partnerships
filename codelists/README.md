# Codelists

The codelists in this folder are customised for OCDS for PPPs, or required by OCDS for PPPs extensions. 

Each codelist is fetched from the relevant extension repository with the exception of the following codelists which are included as part of the public-private-partnerships extension:

* documentType - adds document types specific to OCDS for PPPs to the documentType codelist
* metricID - adds an open codelist of identifiers for metrics, specific to OCDS for PPPs
* milestoneCode - adds an open codelist of milestone codes, specific to OCDS for PPPs
* partyRole - replaces the partyRole codelist in OCDS with codes specific to OCDS for PPPs
* milestoneType - replace the milestoneType codelist in OCDS with codes specific to OCDS for PPPs

<<< to-do: merging of codelists (e.g. documentType from public-private-partnerships and tarrifs extension) >>>
